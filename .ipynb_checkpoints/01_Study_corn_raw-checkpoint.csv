The aim of this study was to compare the impact of four different tillage practices (minimum tillage MT, shallow ploughing SP, ripper subsoiling RS and conventional tillage DP) on soil profile under both continuous and rotating (wheat, bean, maize) maize production since 1970. The field study was conducted on 24 experimental plots on a loam soil of Fagna, Tuscany (Italy), where soil samples were collected at four different layers of 10 cm each, up to a total depth of 40 cm (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm in triplicate) and of 20 cm (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from continuous and rotating maize fields respectively, in order to measure the effect of the different tillage practices on soil organic matter, microbial diversity and microbial activity.",Influence of tillage practices on soil microbial diversity and activity in a long-term corn experimental field under continuous maize production,SUBMITTED,2019-03-26T16:11:31

Here we report a 16S rRNA-based analysis of the gut microbiome in 1,126 twin pairs, a subset of which we previously analyzed. Tripling the sample reduced the confidence intervals around heritability estimates and uncovered newly heritable taxa, many of which are validated in other studies. Repeat sampling of subjects showed heritable taxa to be temporally stable. A candidate gene approach uncovered associations between heritable taxa and genes related to diet, metabolism and olfaction. We replicate an association between Bifidobacterium and the lactase (LCT) gene region and identify an association between ALDH1L1 and SHA-98, suggesting a link between formate production and blood pressure. Additional genes detected are involved in barrier defense and self/non-self recognition. Our results indicate that diet sensing, metabolism, and immune defense are important drivers of human-microbiome co-evolution.",Genetic determinants of the gut microbiome in the TwinsUK cohort,SUBMITTED,2017-04-06T11:26:58

Here, we investigated the relationships of bacterial community structure (>400,000 16S rRNA gene sequences for 112 samples) with function (i.e., bioreactor performance) and environment (i.e., operating conditions) in a yearlong monthly time series of nine full-scale bioreactor facilities treating brewery wastewater (>20,000 measurements). Each of the nine facilities had a unique community structure with an unprecedented level of stability. Using machine learning, we identified a small subset of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 145 out of 4,962), which predicted the location of the facility of origin for almost every sample (96.4% accuracy). Of these 145 OTUs, syntrophic bacteria were systematically overrepresented, demonstrating that syntrophs rebounded following disturbances. This indicates that resilience, rather than dynamic competition, played an important role in maintaining the necessary syntrophic populations. In addition, we explained the observed phylogenetic differences between all samples based on a subset of environmental gradients (using constrained ordination), and found stronger relationships between community structure and its function rather than its environment. These relationships were strongest for two performance variables - methanogenic activity and substrate removal efficiency - both of which were also affected by microbial ecology because these variables were correlated with community evenness (at any given time) and variability in phylogenetic structure (over time), respectively. Thus, we quantified relationships between community structure and function, which opens the door to engineer communities with superior functions.",Bacterial Communiy Structures are Unique and Resilient in Full-Scale Bioenergy Systems,HARVESTED,2017-03-30T16:06:21

Levels of LPS, LBP, and sCD14 were elevated in ME/CFS subjects.  Levels of LBP were correlated with LPS and sCD14 and LPS levels correlated with sCD14. We examined the gut microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed that bacterial diversity was decreased in the ME/CFS specimens compared to controls, in particular a reduction in the relative abundance and diversity of Firmicutes.  The ME/CFS samples also exhibited an increase in the pro-inflammatory family Enterobacteriaceae and decrease in the anti-inflammatory Ruminococcaceae, including Faecalibacterium, and reduced amounts of beneficial Bifidobacterium species.  Using a machine learning approach, individuals were classified correctly as ME/CFS with an average success rate of 0.8928.  Our results indicate dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in this disease and further suggest an increased incidence of microbial translocation, which may play a role in inflammatory symptoms.",Reduced diversity and altered composition of the gut microbiome in individuals with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/ChronicFatigue Syndrome,SUBMITTED,2016-10-21T14:08:13

We performed a 2.5-year case study of the assembly of the human infant gut microbiome to relate life events to microbiome composition and function. Sixty fecal samples were collected from a healthy infant along with a diary of diet and health status. Analysis of >300,000 16S rRNA genes indicated that the phylogenetic diversity of the microbiome increased gradually over time and that changes in community composition conformed to a smooth temporal gradient. In contrast, major taxonomic groups showed abrupt shifts in abundance corresponding to changes in diet or health. Community assembly was nonrandom: we observed discrete steps of bacterial succession punctuated by life events. Furthermore, analysis of ~500,000 DNA metagenomic reads from 12 fecal samples revealed that the earliest microbiome was enriched in genes facilitating lactate utilization, and that functional genes involved in plant polysaccharide metabolism were present prior to the introduction of solid food, priming the infant gut for an adult diet. However, ingestion of table foods caused a sustained increase in the abundance of Bacteroidetes, elevated fecal short chain fatty acid levels, enrichment of genes associated with carbohydrate utilization, vitamin biosynthesis and xenobiotic degradation, and a more stable community composition, all of which are characteristic of the adult microbiome. This study revealed that seemingly chaotic shifts in the microbiome could be attributed to life events.",Developing infant gut microbiome,HARVESTED,2016-01-20T14:12:06
