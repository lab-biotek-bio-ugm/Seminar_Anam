Nuruk is a starchy disk or tablet formed from wheat or grist containing various fungal and bacterial strains from the surrounding environment that are allowed to incorporate naturally into the starter, each of which simultaneously participates in the makgeolli fermentation process. In the current study, changes in microbial dynamics during laboratory-scale fermentation of makgeolli inoculated with six different kinds of nuruk were evaluated by barcoded pyrosequencing using fungal- and bacterial-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region and hypervariable regions V1 to V3 of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. A total of 61,571 fungal and 68,513 bacterial sequences were used for the analysis of microbial diversity in ferment samples. During fermentation, the proportion of fungal microorganisms belonging to the family Saccharomycetaceae increased significantly, and the major bacterial phylum of the samples shifted from ?-Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. The results of quantitative PCR indicated that the bacterial content in the final ferments was higher than in commercial rice beers, while total fungi appeared similar. This is the first report of a comparative analysis of microbial dynamics during the fermentation of alcoholic beverage using barcoded pyrosequencing of bacterial and fungal rRNA genes.",microbial community of traditional Korean alcoholic beverages,HARVESTED,2017-03-23T15:26:09

Here, we selected a cohort of healthy subjects from an indigenous and monitored Sardinian population to analyze their gut microbiota using both shotgun metagenomics and shotgun metaproteomics. We found a considerable divergence between genetic potential and functional activity of the human healthy gut microbiota, in spite of a quite comparable taxonomic structure revealed by the two approaches. Investigation of inter-individual variability of taxonomic features revealed Bacteroides and Akkermansia as remarkably conserved and variable in abundance within the population, respectively. Firmicutes-driven butyrogenesis (mainly due to Faecalibacterium spp.) was shown to be the functional activity with the higher expression rate and the lower inter-individual variability in the study cohort, highlighting the key importance of the biosynthesis of this microbial by-product for the gut homeostasis. The taxon-specific contribution to functional activities and metabolic tasks was also examined, giving insights into the peculiar role of several gut microbiota members in carbohydrate metabolism (including polysaccharide degradation, glycan transport, glycolysis and short-chain fatty acid production). In conclusion, our results provide useful indications regarding the main functions actively exerted by the gut microbiota members of a healthy human cohort, and support metaproteomics as a valuable approach to investigate the functional role of the gut microbiota in health and disease.",Potential and active functions in the gut microbiota of a healthy human cohort,SUBMITTED,2017-02-09T09:33:31
