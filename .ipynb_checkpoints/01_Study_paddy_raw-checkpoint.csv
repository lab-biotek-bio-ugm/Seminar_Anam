These inundated, anoxic soils featuring abundant nitrogen compounds and methane are an ideal niche for nitrate-dependent anaerobic methanotrophs. After 2 years of enrichment with a continuous supply of methane and nitrate as the sole electron donor and acceptor, a stable enrichment dominated by 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' archaea and 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' NC10 phylum bacteria was achieved. The results of qPCR quantification of 16S rRNA gene copies, analysis of metagenomic 16S rRNA reads,and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) correlated well and showed that, after two years, 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens' had the highest (2.2Â±0.4*108) 16S rRNA copies per mL and constituted approximately 22% of the total microbial community.Metagenomic sequencing by Ion Torrent Technology was carried out after one and two years of enrichment. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 16S rRNA genes of the dominant microorganisms clustered with previously described 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D' (96% identity) and 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' (99% identity) strains. The pooled metagenomic sequences resulted in a high-quality draft genome assembly of 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens Vercelli' that contained all key functional genes for the reverse methanogenesis pathway and nitrate reduction. The diagnostic mcrA gene was 96% similar to 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens ANME2D' (WP_048089615.1) at the protein level.The 'Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera' draft genome contained the marker genes pmoCAB, mdh, and nirS and putative NO dismutase genes. Whole-reactor anaerobic activity measurements with methane and nitrate revealed an average methane oxidation rate of 0.012 mmol h-1 L-1, with cell-specific methane oxidation rates up to 0.57 fmol cell-1 day-1 for 'Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens'. In summary, this study describes the first enrichment and draft genome of methanotrophic archaea from paddy field soil, where these organisms can contribute significantly to the mitigation of methane emissions.",Enrichment of anaerobic nitrate-dependent methanotrophic Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens archaea from an Italian paddy field soil,SUBMITTED,2017-04-18T15:15:08
