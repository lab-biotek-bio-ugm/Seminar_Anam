The field study was conducted on 24 experimental plots on a loam soil of Fagna, Tuscany (Italy), where soil samples were collected at four different layers of 10 cm each, up to a total depth of 40 cm (0-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 30-40 cm in triplicate) and of 20 cm (0-10 and 10-20 cm) from continuous and rotating maize fields respectively, in order to measure the effect of the different tillage practices on soil organic matter, microbial diversity and microbial activity.",Influence of tillage practices on soil microbial diversity and activity in a long-term corn experimental field under continuous maize production,SUBMITTED,2019-03-26T16:11:31

The research methods used in this paper have contributed to a better understanding of genetic diversity and composition of the population of fungi in the soil under the influence of the changes that have occurred in the soil under long-term maize cultivation. In all cultivation techniques, thThis study has shown that: (1) fungal diversity was changed under the influence different cultivation techniques; (2) techniques of maize cultivation and season were an important factors that can influence the biochemical activity of soil. Maize cultivated in direct sowing did not cause negative changes in the fungal structure, even making it more stable  during seasonal changes; (3) full tillage and crop rotation may change fungal community and soil function. e season had a great influence on the fungal genetic structure in the soil.","The study includes fungal genetic diversity assessment by ITS-1 next generation sequencing (NGS) analyses.

This study aims to bridge that knowledge gap using the expanded granular sludge-bed bioreactor (EGSB), a high-rate anaerobic digester type, as a model for study.Two laboratory-scale idealizations of the EGSB – a one-dimensional and a three- dimensional scale-down of a full-scale design – were built and operated in triplicate under near-identical conditions to a full-scale EGSB. The laboratory-scale bioreactors were seeded using biomass obtained from the full-scale bioreactor, and, spent water from the distillation of whisky from maize was applied as substrate at both scales. Over 70 days, bioreactor performance, microbial ecology and microbial community physiology were monitored at various depths in the sludge-beds using 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V4 region), specific methanogenic activity (SMA) assays and a range of physical and chemical monitoring methods.SMA assays indicated dominance of the hydrogenotrophic pathway at full-scale whilst a more balanced activity profile developed during the laboratory-scale trials. At each scale, Methanobacterium was the dominant methanogenic genus present. Bioreactor performance overall was better at laboratory-scale than full-scale.  We observed that bioreactor idealization at laboratory-scale significantly influenced spatial distribution of microbial community physiology and taxonomy in the bioreactor sludge-bed, with 1-D bioreactor types promoting stratification of each. In the 1-D laboratory bioreactors, increased abundance of Firmicutes was associated with both granule position in the sludge bed and increased activity against acetate and ethanol as substrates. We further observed that stratification in the sludge-bed in 1-D laboratory-scale bioreactors was associated with increased richness in the underlying microbial community at species (OTU) level and improved overall performance.","Bioreactor scalability: laboratory-scale bioreactor design influences bioreactor performance, ecology and community physiology in expanded granular sludge bed bioreactors",SUBMITTED,2017-06-20T14:25:53

Classical microbiological methods allowed isolation of five hundred eighty-two yeasts identified into 16 species by RFLPs and sequencing of D1/D2 26S rRNA gene. Genetic typing of isolates from the dominant species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by PCR of delta elements revealed up to 42 different patterns. High-throughput sequencing of D1/D2 26S rRNA gene amplicons from chicha samples allowed detection of more than one hundred yeast species and almost fifty filamentous fungi taxa. Analysis of the data revealed that yeasts dominated the fermentation, although, a significant percentage of filamentous fungi appeared in the first step of the process. Statistical examination of results showed that very few taxa were represented by more than 1% of the reads per sample at any step of the process. S. cerevisiae represented more than 90% of the reads in the fermentative samples. Other yeast species, different from S. cerevisiae, dominated the pre-fermentative steps and abounded in fermentative samples when S. cerevisiae was in percentages below 90%. Most yeasts species detected by pyrosequencing were not recovered by cultivation.
