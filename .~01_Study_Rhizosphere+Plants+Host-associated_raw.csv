The first symptom of clubroot disease appeared 14 days after inoculation (DAI) and increased drastically between 14 and 35 DAI. The structure of microbial communities associated to rhizosphere soil and root samples was assessed at each sampling date through sequencing of bacterial (16S) and fungal (18S) molecular markers. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes bacterial phyla dominate the Chinese cabbage rhizosphere and root microbiota. Rhizosphere bacterial communities also contained Actinobacteria and Firmicutes to a higher extend than in the roots. Moreover, a dramatic shift of fungal communities of non-inoculated plants occurred between the two last sampling dates, especially in plant roots but also in their rhizosphere. Most of Ascomycota fungi dominant until then were replaced by a fungus assigned to the Chytriomycota phylum. Parasitic invasion by P. brassicae disrupted the rhizosphere and root-associated community assembly during the vegetative stage of plant growth. These effects occurred late during the secondary cortical infection stage of clubroot disease in plant roots. At this stage, Flavisolibacter and Streptomyces in the rhizosphere, and Bacillus in the roots, were drastically less abundant upon parasite invasion. Rhizosphere of plants colonized by P. brassicae was significantly more invaded by the Chytriomycota fungus, which could reflect a mutualistic relationship in this compartment between these two microorganisms.",Temporal dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities during the infection of Brassica rapa roots by the protist Plasmodiophora brassicae,SUBMITTED,2018-06-08T08:55:13

Recent studies are unravelling the impact of microorganisms from the rhizosphere on such interactions and are gradually changing our perception, but the reverse effect has seldom been investigated. Herbivore attacks on plants could represent important perturbations for belowground communities. Our study aimed at determining how plant herbivory influences resistance and resilience of root and rhizosphere microbial community assemblages and whether potential changes in root metabolites and elemental compounds during herbivory can explain microbial community dynamics. We further questioned the influence of initial soil microbial diversity on these interactions. We conducted our study on a crop plant, oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and one of its major belowground pest, the cabbage root fly (Delia radicum). Soils of different initial microbial diversity were obtained through a removal-recolonization method. Root and rhizosphere sampling targeted different stages of the herbivore development: i) the hatching stage which corresponds to the initiation of herbivory, ii) the third larval instar which corresponds to the peak of herbivory and iii) adult emergence which corresponds to the end of herbivory. Bacterial communities were more affected by herbivory than fungi communities, which appeared very variable. Herbivory was associated to an increase of γ-Proteobacteria and of 5 bacterial dominant genera belonging to this phylum and Firmicutes. Root communities were more resilient than rhizosphere communities. This resilience was partly visible at the root metabolite and nutrient level, which reached back a more stable state at the end of herbivory. But herbivory also induced an increase of sulfur-containing compounds, as well as a couple amino acids and sugars. Three bacterial genera were positively correlated to most metabolites and negatively to nutrients. Further researches would help to identify the biological function of the microbial genera impacted by plant infestation and their potential implication in the plant defense.",Root Herbivory Shapes The Dynamic Of Oilseed Root And Rhizosphere Microbial Communities Through Chemical Changes,SUBMITTED,2018-03-06T12:17:27

Fungal diversity and wood density were inversely related, i.e., OTU richness generally increased as the log became increasingly decomposed. According to generalized additive mixed models white-rot fungi (e.g., Phellinus nigrolimitatus) and members of Hyphodontia did not show a clear response to the wood-density gradient, whereas Phellinus viticola and brown-rot fungi (e.g., Fomitopsis pinicola, Antrodia serialis, Coniophora olivaceae) peaked during intermediate decay and mycorrhizal fungi (e.g., Piloderma, Tylospora, Russula) increased in the later stages.

Soil microorganisms can affect the accumulation of metals by plants by either directly or indirectly stimulating plant growth and activity or by (im)mobilizing and/or complexing metals. Understanding the intricate interplay of metal-accumulating plants with their rhizosphere microbiome is an important step towards the application and optimization of phytoremediation. We studied the effect of a ?native? compared to a strongly disturbed (gamma-irradiated) soil microbial community on cadmium and zinc accumulation by the plant Arabidopsis halleri in soil microcosm experiments. A. halleri accumulated 100% more cadmium and 15% more zinc when grown on the untreated compared to the gamma-irradiated soil. Gamma-irradiation did not affect soil metal bioavailability or plant growth. However, it strongly altered soil microbial community composition and overall cell numbers. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons of DNA extracted from rhizosphere samples of A. halleri revealed distinct differences in microbial community richness and evenness between the untreated and gamma-irradiated soil. Classification and comparative sequence analysis allowed the identification of microbial taxa (Lysobacter, Streptomyces, and Agromyces) that might have enhanced the accumulation of Cd and Zn by A. halleri in the microcosms with the untreated soil. We discuss different mechanisms of interaction of A. halleri with its rhizosphere microbiome that might have directly or indirectly affected plant metal accumulation.

There was extensive overlap in bacterial communities between plant organs, between replicate plants of the same species, between plant species, and between plant organ and rhizosphere soil, with no consistent clustering by compartment or host plant species. Both the lack of clustering in an NMDS ordination and an NMTD analysis suggested that bacterial endophyte OTUs were stochastically distributed amongst plant species and organs, and rhizosphere soil. Percentage turnover of OTUs samples was similar for plant individuals of the same species and of different species, at around 80-90%. Our results suggest that sampling of extra individuals, extra plant organs, extra species, or use of rhizosphere soil, might be about equally effective for obtaining new OTUs for culture.

Root-associated microbes are thought to drive the functioning of plant-based biofilters, or ?biowalls?, converting VOCs into biomass, energy, and carbon dioxide. But little is known about the root communities of such artificially grown plants, how or whether they differ from those grown in soil, and whether any changes in composition are driven by VOCs. In this study, we investigate how bacterial communities on biofilter plant roots change over time and in response to VOC exposure. Through analyses of 16S rRNA amplicon sequence libraries, we compare root communities from soil-grown plants versus those from two biowalls, while also comparing communities from roots exposed to clean- versus VOC-laden- air in a laboratory biofiltration system. Results show differences in bacterial communities between soil- versus biowall-grown plants, and between those from between clean air versus VOC exposed plant roots. Biowall-grown and VOC-exposed roots both harbored enriched levels of bacteria from the genus Hyphomicrobium. Given their known capacities to break down aromatic and halogenated compounds, we hypothesize these bacteria to be important VOC-degraders.

Metalliferous mine tailings, which usually have high acid-generating potentials, are often subject to phytoremediation to prevent the dispersion (by eolian and hydraulic action) of these metal-bearing particles. Assisted phytostabilization is a type of phytoremediation technology in which the mine tailings are amended with compost (as a source of carbon and nutrients, and pH buffer) and then are seeded with a native plant specie that has been specifically selected based on its capacity to grow on the tailings without accumulating elevated levels of toxic metals in the shoot tissues. Therefore, the metal contaminants are immobilized in the soil to minimize the health and environmental risks associated with the dispersion of exposed mine tailings. A major knowledge gap in the understanding of phytostabilization as a viable alternative for the remediation of mine tailing piles is the ecology of the microorganisms that grow in the root-zone of the plants. Little is known of how these microbial communities respond to plant growth and compost amendment, how they may influence the stabilization of the metal contaminants, how they may affect or enhance plant colonization of the tailings, and how their structure may reflect the state of the phytoremediation treatment. To try to answer some of these questions, we conducted a yearlong greenhouse experiment with 3 treatments (in triplicate): (1) tailings only control, (2) tailings amended with 15% compost control, (3) tailings amended with 15% compost and seeded with a shrub (quail-bush; Atriplex lentiformis).

Moreover, genera of Gp1, Gp3, Leptosphaeria and Phaeosphaeriopsis were also significantly enriched in BIO treatment compared to PM and CF treatments. Interestingly, Fusarium was also significantly reduced in BIO treatment compared to CF treatment and a slightly reduce without significance compared to PM treatment. Furthermore, the disease incidence was negatively correlated to the enrichment of Gp1, Gp3, Leptosphaeria and Phaeosphaeriopsis while positively correlated to depletion of Fusarium. In conclusion, the reduction of the Fusarium wilt disease incidence after a 2-year application of bio-fertilizer might be attributed to the fact that application of bio-fertilizer containing Bacillus sp. induced general suppression by modulating rhizosphere the microbial community.",Rhizosphere microbial community manipulated by 2-year consecutive bio-fertilizer application exhibited excellent disease suppression to banana Fusarium wilt disease,HARVESTED,2016-04-13T13:37:02

Using RNA based metatranscriptomics, the global active microbiomes were analysed in soil and rhizospheres of wheat, oat, pea, and an oat mutant (sad1) deficient in production of antifungal avenacins.  Rhizosphere microbiomes differed from bulk soil and between plant species. Pea (a legume) had a much stronger effect on the rhizosphere than wheat and oat (cereals), resulting in a dramatically different rhizosphere community. The relative abundance of eukaryotes in the oat and pea rhizospheres was more than five-fold higher than in the wheat rhizosphere or bulk soil. Nematodes and bacterivorous protozoa were enriched in all rhizospheres, while the pea rhizosphere was highly enriched for fungi. Metabolic capabilities for rhizosphere colonisation were selected, including cellulose degradation (cereals), H2-oxidation (pea) and methylotrophy (all plants). Avenacins had little effect on the prokaryotic community of oat, but the eukaryotic community was strongly altered in the sad1 mutant, suggesting that avenacins have a broader role than protecting from fungal pathogens. Profiling microbial communities with metatranscriptomics allows comparison of relative abundance, from multiple samples, across all domains of life, without PCR bias. This revealed profound differences in the rhizosphere microbiome particularly at the kingdom level between plants.",Rhizosphere metatranscriptomics,SUBMITTED,2016-01-20T14:12:06

Here we used metatranscriptomic analysis of rRNA depleted RNA from the rhizospheres of wheat, oat, pea, and unplanted soil to compare the metabolic functions of microbes in these environments. Using biological replication (n=5) we were able to give statisistical significance to the differences found. Microbes responsed to the rhizosphere environment by increasing metabolic activity in general, and particularly in metabolic pathways involved in sugar, organic acid and aromatics metabolism, oxidative stress, and motility. While general rhizosphere effects on the microbial communities were observed, many specific effects were plant species dependent.","Transcriptomic analysis of microbial communities isolated from the rhizospheres of wheat, oat and pea, compared to unplanted soil",SUBMITTED,2016-01-20T14:12:06

The dilution procedure leads to reduction of the diversity of bacteria at the phylum level.
